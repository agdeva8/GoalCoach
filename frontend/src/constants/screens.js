 * The Coach screens — one entry per distinct URL.
 *
 * Shared by the desktop tab strip (Coach.js), the GoalMenu dropdown, and
 * the mobile large-title bar, so labels, icons and destinations can never
 * drift apart.
 *
 * Routing note: `/` is the **Home** screen — the canonical landing — and
 * the other screens ride on `?panel=<key>` instead of their own pathname.
 * Coach.js is keyed by `location.pathname` (see App.js' ViewTransition
 * comment), so keeping the pathname constant across panel switches
 * guarantees the page never remounts: chat, dashboard data and scroll
 * survive every switch, and browser/system back still steps
 * screen-by-screen because each switch is a history push.
 *
 * Home (per founder feedback) is the personal landing: greeting +
 * recommendation + today at a glance + a goals preview. Goals holds the
 * actual goal list.
